# easy_schrodinger_scripts

A collection of scripts designed to simplify and automate various tasks for Schr√∂dinger molecular modelling software. These scripts aim to enhance productivity and streamline user workflows on high-performance computing (HPC) systems, such as the [Lengau CHPC cluster](https://wiki.chpc.ac.za/quick:start).

### **easy_desmond_report**

This script automates the generation of Desmond molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) reports (e.g., RMSD, RMSF plots, and related data) directly on the [Lengau CHPC cluster](https://wiki.chpc.ac.za/quick:start). Many users interested in generating these reports often download large trajectory folders (`*_trj`) and output CMS files (`*-out.cms`) to their local machines to generate reports with the Simulation Interaction Diagram. However, this process can be data-intensive for sizable systems and long simulations.

With `easy_desmond_report`, the entire process happens on the cluster, reducing data transfer requirements. The reports are saved in a compact directory, ready for seamless download.

#### **Features:**

- Optimized for the [Lengau CHPC cluster](https://wiki.chpc.ac.za/quick:start).
- Automates report generation.
- Saves time and minimizes data usage.

#### **Resources:**
